# Introduction to Transformer-Based Natural Language Processing

## Overview
This lab is part of the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) course on Transformer-Based Natural Language Processing (NLP). The lab provides hands-on experience with state-of-the-art transformer models, such as BERT, GPT, and T5, for various NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

The lab is designed to help you understand the architecture of transformer models, how they process sequential data, and how to fine-tune pre-trained models for specific NLP tasks using NVIDIA's powerful GPU-accelerated libraries.
